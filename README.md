This project leverages predictive analytics to forecast disease progression and treatment response based on user-entered symptoms. The frontend is built using React, the backend is developed using .NET, and PostgreSQL is used for database management.

## Features
- **Symptom Analysis:** Users can input their symptoms into the system for analysis.
- **Disease Prediction:** The system utilizes predictive analytics to forecast potential diseases or health conditions based on the symptoms provided.
- **Treatment Recommendations:** Upon disease prediction, the system recommends appropriate treatments, including medications and lifestyle adjustments.
- **Doctor Consultation:** Users receive suggestions for healthcare providers or doctors specializing in the predicted diseases for further consultation and treatment planning.
- **Medicine Search:** Users can search for medicines available on the website based on their needs.
- **Doctor Search:** Users can find doctors based on specific departments or medical specialties.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Users can schedule appointments with doctors for consultations and medical advice.
